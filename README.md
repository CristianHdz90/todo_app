### How to use it

Because this application function on heroku, you'll need to deploy it on that platform.

Then you must set the following environment variable that flask needs to work.

Bash example:
```bash
export SECRET_KEY_FLASK="uALZuZSksQLeQ4@&_%EwHakWke_Fm-=^3=cqxUC@U+VQc!W7tEp_6Pm?6@+wZJ-UR"
```
Make sure that the secret key is secure (and don't use the same of above)
