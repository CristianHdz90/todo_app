## How to use it in production and development

Note: Before starting with these steps you have to run the docker-compose.yml in your machine if you are in a development environment or the heroku.yml on the Heroku platform if you want to start the app in production.

Requirements:
* you must have a Heroku account, this will be used to deploy our app. (This because I've done this application to be deployed on this platform)
* Also you must have an account of Google Cloud Platform, this will be required to use the Firestore service (our database).

Steps:

*This first step is only for **production environment***

1. First of all you have to set the following environment variable that flask needs to work. 

    *Bash example*:
    ```bash
    export SECRET_KEY_FLASK="uALZuZSksQLeQ4@&_%EwHakWke_Fm-=^3=cqxUC@U+VQc!W7tEp_6Pm?6@+wZJ-UR"
    ```
    Make sure that the secret key is secure (and don't use the same of above)

2. Now you will need one file named `KeyFile.json`, this file must contain the credentials for the app to connect it to the Firestore service. Then, you just need to put it in the **/config** directory.

    How to get the credentials?

    To get these credentials you will need to create a key file linked to one service account, you can read about it [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).

3. Once the above is done, you just need to set the next environment variable that contains the route to the credentials file to authenticate your app with Firestore.

    *Bash example*:
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/todo_app/config/KeyFile.json"
    ```

    Note: If you're in the development environment you have to call the application with the 5000 port, e.g.

    ```bash
    flask run -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000 
    ```
